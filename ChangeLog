v. 2.4.1, 2020-08-08
- implemented a 16-colour palette that uses the same RGB values as
  Turbo C. This palette is used if the environment variable
  SDL_BGI_PALETTE is set to "BGI"

  (requested by Austin Hurst)
- added initpalette() to restore the original 16 colours in the

  Mesquita: added installuserfont(). Does not work on Windows.

  the top)

v. 2.4.0, 2020-02-20
- Hershey font support as a replacement for the original Borland
  .chr fonts (suggested by Marco Diego Aurélio Mesquita)
- if the SDL_BGI_RES environment variable is set to "VGA", 
  initgraph (DETECT, ...) forces VGA (640x480) resolution
- fixed missing refresh() in getch()
- fixed long-standing bug in settextjustify() when text is vertical
- fixed long-standing compatibility problem with kbhit()

v. 2.3.1, 2020-01-20

  faster pixel manipulation; added showinfobox(), getleftclick(), 
  getmiddleclick(), getrightclick() 
- documentation updates and improvements
- added test/bgidemo.c
- code cleanup

v. 2.3.0, 2019-08-01
- added 'auto mode': initgraph() performs automatic screen refresh
  when the environment variable SDL_BGI_RATE is set to 'auto' or to
  the desired refresh rate (e.g. 60). This can be used as an
  alternative to 'slow mode', and it provides a huge performance
  boost. The new function sdlbgiauto() is also available. BEWARE:
  automatic refresh may not work on some NVIDIA graphics cards.
